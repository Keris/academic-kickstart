I'm Du Liqiang, now a software development engineer in YouXin Financial. Before this I worked as an algorithm engineer of information retrieval in Sina Weibo and a bioinformational software development engineer in Novogene. My interests include risk management in internet banking, information retrieval and recommendation systems.
